"""
Which subjects a teacher is allowed to see.

Chapters, notes and study material are scoped through this, so a teacher sees
their own subject rather than every subject in the school.

The awkward part is that the same person has two identities:

    sss_users_masters.user_id      3       (bigint)
    sss_teacher_master.teacher_id  'T02'   (varchar)

and sss_subject_master.teacher_id is a foreign key to *user_id*, not to the
teacher table. Email is the only thing linking the two rows, so that is what
we bridge on.

Resolution order:
  1. sss_subject_master.teacher_id == the teacher's user_id  (the real
     assignment; requires a matching row in sss_users_masters)
  2. sss_subject_master.subject_name matched against the teacher's
     subject_name — a fallback for schools that never fill in the assignment
