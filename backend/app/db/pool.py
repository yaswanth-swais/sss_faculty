"""
Connection-pool sizing, derived from the database rather than hand-set.

The pool is elastic: a quiet service holds one connection, a busy one grows and
then releases. The ceiling is computed at startup from the server's own
`max_connections` divided by the workers sharing it, so resizing the instance
or deploying to another school needs no code change.

Reference implementation — the other backends should copy this file.
